// went idle without a turn while its sender saw `delivered`.
// - Claude: `claude agents --json --all` (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-view,

//   expired login", and `waitingFor` names an open prompt. Progress is a done
//   session, one still working WORKING_SETTLE_MS after the start, or one
//   blocked on a prompt its turn raised. Any other state (for example idle) is none.
// - Codex: an `item.*` event or `turn.completed` in the run's events

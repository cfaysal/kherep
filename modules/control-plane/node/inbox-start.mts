// removes the replies that are the only evidence a delivered record was

//
// Issue #581: the daemon runs it once, after its first authenticated
// connection or MAINTENANCE_FALLBACK_MS after its start without one, in slices
// of about MAINTENANCE_SLICE_MS off the frame lanes, so its cost, which grows with
// the queue, never delays the connection the service health stage waits for.

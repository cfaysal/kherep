// issue: `codex exec --json` prints JSON Lines events, `thread.started` with

// message; without closed stdin it waits for more input. The prompt goes in on
// stdin (`-`: "instructions are read from stdin"), never as an argument that
// `ps` would show for the whole run; stdin is closed right after it. `codex exec resume`
// has no `-C`, `--sandbox` or `--add-dir`: it takes the sandbox as `-c
// sandbox_mode=...`, the extra writable root as `-c
// sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots=[...]`, and runs in the process's

// The confirmed owner stop of a Claude background task (issue #437, PR 2),
// after the shared checks in task-control-local.mts. Measured on macOS
// (Claude Code 2.1.300): the listed pid is the session process, MCP servers
// are its children, and a Bash tool command is a descendant in its own process
// group. `claude stop` returns at once and the row shows no pid while the
// process still lives; the session process ends, a running shell command does
// not. A session process killed without `claude stop` is restarted by the
// supervisor. So the stop captures the whole tree first, runs `claude stop`,
// waits for every captured identity, re-captures the tree from its live
// members after `claude stop` and before each signal, signals only survivors
// by pid while each keeps its captured start, and never the session process:
// alive after the grace it is `stop_failed`, unsignalled. Windows stays
// refused until measured there.

// OP-963: shared label and component field logic for both Jira brokers.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The same reason jira-adf.mts exists: both brokers already sit
// above the 250-LOC limit from CLAUDE.md, and two copies of a rule drift apart by
// the second bug fix. Everything here is pure - the caller owns the HTTP, this
// module owns the decisions - so every branch is reachable from a test without a
// network.
//
// THE FIELD SHAPES ARE READ OFF THE SPEC, NOT REMEMBERED (CLAUDE.md rule 5).
// Jira Cloud v3 OpenAPI, pulled 2026-08-24 from
// developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/swagger-v3.v3.json:
//   - the create-issue example carries fields.labels as ["bugfix","blitz_test"]
//     and fields.components as [{"id":"10000"}],
//   - GET /rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/components answers with an array
//     of ProjectComponent, whose id and name are both declared as strings, and
//     whose path parameter is documented as "The project ID or project key".

// OP-1124. The three states of a field plan entry are the reason these types
// exist at all: null means the flag was absent, so the field stays untouched;
// an empty list or a null accountId means the flag was given empty, which is the
// clearing edit. A single optional string would have collapsed the two.

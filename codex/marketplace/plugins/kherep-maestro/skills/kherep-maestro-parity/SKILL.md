# Kherep Maestro Parity

1. Read `~/.codex/orchestra/ROUTING.md` and the latest `~/.codex/orchestra/parity-receipt.json`.
2. Treat the versioned `codex/parity/capabilities.json` in the Kherep checkout as the capability contract.
3. Compare names and readiness only. Never print MCP endpoints, headers, environment values, tokens, or secret-bearing configuration.
4. Verify current plugin and tool state from live Codex state, never from memory or cache-directory guesses.
5. Report each capability as `ready`, `configured-not-authenticated`, `missing`, or `not-applicable`.
6. Do not modify `~/.claude` or any Claude plugin, hook, setting, worker, provider, or memory database.
7. Repair Codex only through the versioned Orchestra installer. On Windows run `codex/install.ps1`; on macOS run `codex/install.sh`.
8. After repair, start a fresh Codex task and functionally verify routing, skill discovery, agent discovery, hooks, the configured wiki, and explicitly selected Central memory.

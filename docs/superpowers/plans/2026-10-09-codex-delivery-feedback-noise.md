# Codex Delivery Feedback Noise Plan

> **For agentic workers:** implement this plan task by task only after the Director authorizes production changes.

**Goal:** Keep Codex peer-message delivery reliable while replacing transport-heavy Stop feedback with one fixed concise cue.

**Architecture:** Keep the existing delivery state machine and `msg inbox --receive` path. SessionStart and every UserPromptSubmit developer context own the exact session-bound receive recipe, including when the inbox is empty. Stop owns only the fixed cue that starts one bounded continuation. The continuation retrieves framed peer context through the existing CLI, and its next Stop confirms what was offered.

**Current authorized phase:** Codex-only source implementation, functional verification and merge after green acceptance are now authorized. [Authority record at #365](https://github.com/cfaysal/kherep/issues/365#issuecomment-6095123268). Live installation and activation remain excluded. The [existing-owner addendum](2026-10-10-codex-quiet-owner-cutover.md) governs the separate A/B artifacts and target cutover.

**Related plan:** [Codex Hook Noise Implementation Plan](2026-10-09-codex-hook-noise.md) covers the separate PostToolUse and research-feedback work in the same draft PR.

## Documented runtime boundary

The official Hooks reference documents that:

- [SessionStart](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#sessionstart) can add developer context for `startup`, `resume`, `clear` and `compact`, including after automatic compaction.
- [Stop](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#stop) uses a blocking reason as a new continuation prompt. Peer text, identifiers and transport details therefore stay out of that reason.
- [Common output fields](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#common-output-fields) describe `systemMessage` as a UI warning and say `suppressOutput` is parsed but not implemented. Neither is a hidden delivery channel.
- [Large hook output](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#large-hook-output) may spill to a file. This plan keeps the Stop reason small and uses the already-bounded receive context instead.

Installed source and repository tests establish configured behavior only. Actual Codex Desktop display, styling, wake behavior and model execution remain UNKNOWN until a later authorized target check.

## Delivery contract

The stage-B Stop output is exactly:

```text
Kherep: New peer messages are waiting. Check this session's inbox and report any relevant update.
```

It remains a JSON `decision: "block"`. It contains no peer text, sender or message id, session id, CLI command, local path or escalation instruction.

SessionStart keeps the current identity, send command, session-list command and escalation note. It additionally gives the exact command:

```text
<cli> msg inbox --from <session-id> --receive
```

Every UserPromptSubmit carries the same receive recipe and reporting instruction, even for an empty or foreign-only inbox. The recipe is deducted from the existing context-byte budget before peer framing. SessionStart alone does not offer messages. The developer context tells the agent to report relevant peer content with attribution without echoing transport instructions.

No hidden output channel, new hook event, MCP substitute, delivery-disable switch or `wake.enabled` interpretation is introduced.

## State and safety invariants

| Before | Event | After | Visible behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| old `offered` | Stop | `delivered` | confirms the completed carrying turn |
| new `accepted` | eligible Stop | `accepted` | one concise block; content is not yet acknowledged |
| new `accepted` | explicit `--receive` | `offered` | nonce-framed peer context with authority warning |
| `offered` | repeated `--receive` | same offer count | no reoffer, even after the retry window |
| `offered` | next Stop | `delivered` | confirms the receive continuation completed |

Delivery remains at least once with bounded reoffers. Do not claim exactly once.

The Stop path keeps its current checks: enrollment, supported event, a valid Codex session id followed by the hook's session recording, arrivals, `continued === true`, continuation permission, bypass-permission refusal and shared continuation budget. Do not strengthen the continued check to require literal `false`.

The receive path keeps session validation before state changes, `reofferOffered: false`, message and byte bounds, nonce framing, peer-content authority, reply-depth limits and session isolation. Attribution ownership remains unchanged.

### Task 1: Add test-only contracts (original completed phase)

**Files:**

- Create: `modules/control-plane/node/deliver-codex-feedback.contract.test.mts`
- Create: `modules/control-plane/node/codex-stop-receive-preservation.contract.test.mts`
- Create: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-09-codex-delivery-feedback-noise.md`
- Modify only for a link: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-09-codex-hook-noise.md`

- [x] Add RED assertions for the exact concise Stop cue and absence of CLI, path, ids and escalation detail.
- [x] Add RED SessionStart assertions for `startup`, `resume`, `clear` and `compact`, including the exact receive recipe and reporting instruction while preserving identity, send, list and escalation text.
- [x] Add a GREEN adversarial-field assertion proving peer-controlled values do not enter the current Stop reason.
- [x] Add GREEN preservation assertions for old-offer confirmation, new-arrival acceptance, explicit receive, next-Stop confirmation, repeated receive, continuation denial, bypass permissions, no enrollment, invalid input/session, unsupported events and no arrivals.
- [x] Leave every production file and existing test unchanged.

Run the preservation contract separately:

```sh
node --test modules/control-plane/node/codex-stop-receive-preservation.contract.test.mts
```

Expected now: all pass.

Run the future presentation contract separately:

```sh
node --test modules/control-plane/node/deliver-codex-feedback.contract.test.mts
```

Original RED baseline: the adversarial peer-field check passed; the concise Stop and four SessionStart recipe checks failed for the intended absent behavior. The transport-hygiene check also failed because the old Stop feedback contained the recipe and escalation note. Stage-B source makes all seven contracts green.

### Task 2: Supply the recipe before shortening Stop (authorized source implementation)

**Files later:**

- Modify: `modules/control-plane/node/deliver-codex.mts`
- Modify display assertions only: `modules/control-plane/node/deliver-codex.test.mts`
- Modify display assertions only: `modules/control-plane/node/codex-stop-receive.test.mts`

- [x] Pin stage A with receive context at SessionStart and every UserPromptSubmit, while preserving the verbose Stop presentation.
- [x] Pin stage B separately with the exact fixed Stop cue.
- [x] Keep `deliver-core.mts`, `msg-inbox.mts`, autonomy, framing, state transitions and attribution unchanged.
- [x] Update old verbose-presentation assertions while retaining all existing process and state assertions.
- [x] Make both new contract files green.

No new helper module is needed unless later implementation evidence proves the existing seam insufficient.

### Task 3: Verify preserved behavior (authorized source phase)

Run the unchanged affected suites:

```sh
node --test modules/control-plane/node/deliver-codex.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/codex-stop-receive.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/deliver-hook.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/deliver-confirm.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/delivery-identity.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/addressing-depth.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/autonomy.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/msg-inbox.test.mts modules/control-plane/node/codex-sessions.test.mts codex/lib/external-delivery-attribution.test.mts
```

These suites retain process-level receive coverage, nonce-framed peer authority, reply-depth, byte and message bounds, retries, isolation, continuation budgets, identity checks and attribution ownership.

Then run:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run test:bootstrap
npm run test:control-plane
```

Report pass, fail and skip counts separately. Inspect the final remote diff and verify production changes are limited to the separately authorized implementation files.

### Task 4: Same-owner runtime acceptance (later, separately authorized activation)

- [ ] Use the same isolated original Codex owner across both stages, with an old-context turn before stage A; a newly created chat alone cannot establish cutover.
- [ ] Capture the actual owner's stage-A SessionStart or UserPromptSubmit recipe and finish any pre-A running turn before stage B.
- [ ] Exercise clear and compaction, then prove the receive recipe remains available through documented SessionStart developer context.
- [ ] Deliver a synthetic peer message, observe the concise Stop cue, and verify the model executes the recipe from developer context.
- [ ] Verify the response presents relevant peer content with attribution and does not echo transport instructions.
- [ ] Verify explicit receive changes `accepted -> offered` and the following Stop changes `offered -> delivered`.

This acceptance must not use private sessions, configuration, endpoints or inventories. Desktop UI styling and wake behavior remain UNKNOWN unless measured at the actual target under separate authority.

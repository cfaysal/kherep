/**
 * research-stop.mts  -  Stop hook (evidence-first enforcement, OP-1440)
 *
 * ROUTING.md "Evidence first": a relevant directive is researched before it is
 * answered - the Central Brain always, the code graph as well when the turn
 * changed code in a repository. research-first.mts asks for that on every
 * prompt; this hook sends a substantial turn back ONCE with a fixed instruction
 * when it shows neither the research nor the visible classification
 * [research: none - <reason>]. Pure-regex over the local transcript plus local
 * existence checks for .git, NO model call, NO network.
 *
 * Silent (the turn may end) when any holds:
 *   1. stop_hook_active is not exactly false - a continuation is never
 *      re-blocked, so there is no loop, with this hook or with
 *      observation-stop.mts, which uses the same guard
 *   2. cwd is outside the configured Kherep workspace
 *   3. the transcript is missing, unreadable or empty
 *   4. the ending turn is trivial - the predicate observation-stop.mts uses
 *   5. the ending turn opts out with [research: none ...]
 *   6. the ending turn made a Brain lookup and, if it changed files inside a git
 *      repository, also queried the code graph
 *
 * Besides the built-in lookups, a Skill named in the optional operator file
 * <claude-home>/kherep/research-sources.json, {"brainSkills": ["<skill>", ...]},
 * counts as a Brain lookup. A missing, unreadable or malformed file adds nothing.
 *
 * PRIVACY. The reason is fixed text plus the configured workspace and the
 * installed space key, exactly what research-first.mts prints. Nothing from the
 * transcript or the payload reaches stdout. Any error fails open.

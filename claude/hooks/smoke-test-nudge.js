/**
 * smoke-test-nudge.js  -  SessionStart hook
 *
 * Makes the state of the install/guard assertions visible without paying for
 * them at session start. bootstrap/smoke-test.sh installs both host profiles
 * into throwaway homes and needs minutes, so this hook never waits for it: it
 * reads the report the previous run left behind and speaks up when that report
 * is missing, stale, incomplete, or reports failing assertions.
 *
 * Report (written by bootstrap/smoke-test.sh):
 *   <CLAUDE_HOME>/.cache/smoke-test/last-report.txt
 *
 * When the report is missing or stale the hook also spawns smoke-test.sh
 * DETACHED and returns immediately - same self-refresh as drift-check-nudge.js.
 * A failing report is NOT rerun: it needs a human, not another run.
 *
 * Fail-safe: any error exits 0 silently. Never blocks a session start.
 *
 * GRUND: the 2026-08-05 wired-hook assertion existed and still missed a live
 * commit-guard.js sitting at 0 bytes for 19 hours, because nothing ever ran it.
 * An assertion that only runs when a human remembers is not an assertion.

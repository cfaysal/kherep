/**
 * obs-result-check.mts  -  SubagentStop hook (observation result check)
 *
 * Issue #326. claude-obs starts its final message with exactly one OBS-RESULT
 * status line (claude/agents/claude-obs.md, Result), and the Maestro reports a
 * failed or missing one to the user (ROUTING.md, Session observations). A
 * result once read `OBS-RESULT: failed wrote 4 pages: 1,2,3,4`, which says
 * neither. This hook checks the line with lib/obs-result-policy.mts before the
 * result reaches the Maestro. Pure-regex, NO model call.
 *
 * Issue #555. On Claude Code v2.1.271 or later a subagent with the
 * SubagentHandback tool delivers its report through that tool, and
 * last_assistant_message holds only its closing text (claude-hooks.md,
 * SubagentStop). The tool is provided only in auto mode (claude-tools-reference.md).
 * The PostToolUse hook obs-handback-record.mts checks the delivered report and
 * records its verdict (lib/obs-handback-state.mts). In order:
 *
 *   - agent_type is not claude-obs: silent. The matcher already filters on it.
 *   - a recorded delivery for this agent_id: silent; the recorder has judged it.
 *     A record whose tool_use_id differs from the last handback visible in the
 *     transcript is stale (a resumed subagent keeps its id) and is dropped.
 *   - the order of the recorder and this hook is not documented, so without a
 *     record the hook waits up to 2 s for one, only when one can still come:
 *     permission_mode is "auto" or the transcript shows a handback call.
 *   - a SubagentHandback call in the subagent transcript: its message is judged
 *     with a notice and never a block; a call whose tool_result is an error, or
 *     that has none yet, is reported as such.
 *   - permission_mode "auto" without any evidence: a notice, never a block,
 *     because the closing text is then never the report.
 *   - otherwise the final message, as before: a valid wrote or empty line is
 *     silent, a valid failed line a systemMessage, a malformed line with
 *     stop_hook_active exactly false one decision "block" (Claude Code delivers
 *     the reason to the subagent as its next instruction), a malformed line on
 *     the continuation a systemMessage only, no visible result a systemMessage.
 *     The message comes from last_assistant_message, else from the last
 *     assistant text of agent_transcript_path.
 *   - any error: a one-line systemMessage, exit 0.
 *
 * Without a valid agent_id there is no record, no wait and no state write.
 * With one, the hook clears the record, prunes state older than 24 h and writes
 * <agent_id>.stop, the fixed-key trace of the host measurement, after the
 * decision. Known limits: when the recorder lands after this hook's transcript
 * branch, the operator can see the same notice twice; a resumed subagent whose
 * transcript shows no handback accepts an old record, and one whose last visible
 * handback is the previous run's, matching the old record, stays silent for the new run.
 *
 * PRIVACY. The block reason is a constant, and every systemMessage is built
 * from constants and the policy's fixed problem texts. Nothing from the
 * message, the transcript or the payload reaches stdout or the state files.

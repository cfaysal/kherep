/**
 * orphan-check-nudge.mts  -  SessionStart hook
 *
 * Keeps the knowledge space's orphan count visible. A page nothing links to is
 * reachable only by search, and the whole point of the linking contract is that
 * the space stops producing them. A contract nobody measures is a wish.
 *
 * Report (written by bootstrap/orphan-check.sh):
 *   <CLAUDE_HOME>/.cache/orphan-check/last-report.txt
 *
 * Like drift-check-nudge.js this never waits for the check: the scan reads every
 * page body in the space and takes minutes. It reads the previous report and,
 * when that report is missing or stale, spawns the check DETACHED for the next
 * session.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, deliberately: it never stitches. The check is read-only.
 * Stitching writes pages in a live space, and a writer triggered automatically
 * by a session start is a different risk class than a reader - the operator
 * decides when links get written, the machine decides when to count.
 *
 * Silent when the last run was recent and found nothing.

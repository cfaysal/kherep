/**
 * live-hook-integrity.mts  -  SessionStart hook, and the re-check of guard-dispatch
 *
 * Proves that every hook file wired in the LIVE settings, plus the transitive
 * closure of their relative imports under hooks/ (lib/hook-inventory.mts), can
 * load, and restores it from the versioned source when it cannot. A missing or
 * 0-byte lib kills its importer at import with exit 1, which Claude Code treats
 * as non-blocking (issue #273); a 0-byte guard runs, enforces nothing, exits 0.
 *
 * States, never merged (goldene Regel 12): OK, DEFEKT (absent, 0 bytes, rejected
 * by Node's parser, lib/hook-syntax.mts, issue #278), UNGEPRUEFT (the read or the
 * check failed). A restore counts only when MEASURED at the target: SHA-256 equal
 * to the source (goldene Regel 13). The source comes from lib/orchestra-checkout,
 * not the session cwd; the write (lib/restore-write.mts) lands in the checked
 * regular file or nowhere. A restore changes what the file imports, so the walk
 * is repeated, at most three passes, until it finds nothing new.
 * Own libs load dynamically (loadLibs, issue #279), so a broken one is reported.
 *
 * Heartbeat and coordination (issue #507, part 2): this hook is the one
 * integrity writer. kherep/hook-runtime/entry.mts admits it EXCLUSIVE on its
 * hooks directory before it loads anything, and every repair goes through the
 * runtime's durable intent (lib/integrity-run.mts). Only a run whose final
 * read-only proof passed (lib/integrity-proof.mts) writes <home>/.cache/
 * hook-integrity/heartbeat.json. Started without the runtime, for another
 * hooks directory, or next to a wired command that bypasses the runtime, it
 * reports and repairs nothing. `--trigger <source>` (guard-dispatch.mts, the
 * entry) prints plain lines instead of the SessionStart JSON. Any unexpected
 * error is reported, exit 0; silent at session start when everything is OK.

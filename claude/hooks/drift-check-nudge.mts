/**
 * drift-check-nudge.js  -  SessionStart hook
 *
 * Makes repo-vs-live drift visible without paying for it at session start.
 * bootstrap/drift-check.sh needs ~2 minutes on Windows, so this hook never
 * waits for it: it reads the report the previous run left behind and speaks up
 * when that report is stale or shows drift.
 *
 * Report (written by bootstrap/drift-check.sh):
 *   <CLAUDE_HOME>/.cache/drift-check/last-report.txt
 *
 * It warns when the report is missing, older than MAX_AGE_HOURS, or contains
 * DRIFT / MISSING lines. Silent when the last run was recent and clean.
 *
 * SELF-REFRESH (2026-08-05): when the report is missing or stale, the hook also
 * spawns drift-check.sh DETACHED and returns immediately. Session start stays
 * instant; the report is fresh for the next one. The earlier note here said
 * running the check from a hook was not an option - that held for a synchronous
 * run and no longer applies to a detached one. Without this the report only ever
 * refreshes when a human remembers, which is exactly how two wired guards were
 * able to sit broken undetected.
 *
 * The alternative was an OS-level scheduled task per machine. Rejected: it lives
 * outside the repo, needs separate Windows and macOS mechanisms, is not
 * versioned or testable, and a fresh box silently lacks it.
 *
 * Refresh is skipped when a run is already in progress, when the workspace has
 * no kherep checkout, or when KHEREP_DRIFT_AUTOREFRESH=0.
 *
 * Fail-safe: any error exits 0 silently. Never blocks a session start.
 *
 * GRUND: the Maestro banner fix lived only in ~/.claude for two days while the
 * repo kept the superseded version. drift-check.sh would have caught it on day
 * one - nothing ever ran it.

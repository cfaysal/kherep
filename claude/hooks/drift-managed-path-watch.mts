/**
 * drift-managed-path-watch.mts  -  PostToolUse hook (Edit|Write|MultiEdit)
 *
 * Says at WRITE TIME that the file just written is one that
 * bootstrap/drift-check.sh manages, and names its versioned source in the repo.
 *
 * The gap this closes: drift-check-nudge.js is a SessionStart hook that replays
 * the PREVIOUS run's report and only nags at 24h staleness. Between the edit and
 * the next session start nothing says a word. On 2026-08-06 an edit to
 * D:\workspace\CLAUDE.md produced no hint at all that claude/CLAUDE.project.md is
 * its source - only umlaut-translit-watch fired.
 *
 * The live -> source map lives in drift-managed-pairs.mts, next to this file.
 * drift-managed-path-watch.test.mts parses the cmp_file/cmp_tree invocations out
 * of drift-check.sh and asserts that map covers every live target they name, so
 * the two cannot drift apart unnoticed.
 *
 * Fail-safe: soft warning only, never blocks, any error exits 0 silently.

// written atomically or not at all, with a 30-minute boundary on its age; Claude's
// runs are serialized by the hook runtime (hook-runtime-*.test.mts). The run lock
// of the Codex integrity hook (part 3): an EXCLUSIVE SQLite transaction held by
// real processes (lock-holder.fixture.mts), so the Windows hooks shard measures
// the release on exit too. Every case runs in its own mkdtemp home.

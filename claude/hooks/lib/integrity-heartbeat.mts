// Heartbeat of live-hook-integrity.mts (issue #507, part 2).
//
// The heartbeat <home>/.cache/hook-integrity/heartbeat.json says when the last
// fully proven integrity run ended. It is written to a temporary file in the same
// directory and renamed into place, so a reader sees the old bytes or the new
// ones, never a partial file. guard-dispatch.mts judges its age by one stat of
// the mtime against the same 30-minute window. The Codex integrity hook also
// records its three dispatcher files in a "peers" field (issue #507, part 4),
// each from provenPeer below; the Claude writer passes none and its bytes stay.
//
// Claude's integrity runs need no lock here: the hook runtime's coordination
// database (kherep/hook-runtime) serializes them, and every heartbeat change
// happens while the integrity writer holds it EXCLUSIVE; that writer never calls
// takeRunLock. Codex has no hook runtime (issue #507, part 3), so its integrity
// hook takes run.lock: an EXCLUSIVE transaction on its own SQLite database,
// <home>/.cache/hook-integrity/run.lock.sqlite (rollback journal DELETE, busy
// timeout 0: every attempt is answered at once). The operating system keeps that
// lock for the holding process and releases it when the process ends, so it is
// never taken over, moved or deleted by another run. A second run is told "busy,
// holder UNKNOWN" after BUSY_RETRIES short retries (issue #620, below). Nothing is
// written into the database: the transaction is the lock and is never committed,
// and the file is permanent. `PRAGMA user_version = 0` inside it proves the file
// writable: a read-only file, whose BEGIN EXCLUSIVE would exclude nothing, is
// refused as unavailable. Network filesystems are not supported for it.
// Static imports: node:* only; node:sqlite is loaded when the lock is taken, so a
// Node without it still loads this file and only the lock is unavailable.

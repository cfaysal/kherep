// Issue #700. The reason line a denial records: a guard that prints a header ending in `:` and
// then its violations records the first violation without its list marker; every other reason
// keeps its first non-empty line. Path reduction, the private-marker refusal and the 240 cut
// apply to the chosen line, and the refusal also to the skipped header. The guard tag still
// comes from the first line.

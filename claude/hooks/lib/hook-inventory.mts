/**
 * hook-inventory.mts  -  which files Node has to load for the wired hooks to run
 *
 * Two parts. The wiring: every hook file named in a command of the live
 * settings, under <CLAUDE_HOME>/hooks/ (moved here from live-hook-integrity.mts
 * unchanged). The import closure: every file those hooks reach through relative
 * static imports, transitively, bounded to the same hooks directory.
 *
 * GRUND (issue #273): `node --check` does not resolve imports. A hook whose
 * lib/*.mts is missing or 0 bytes passes the syntax check and then dies at
 * import with exit 1, which Claude Code treats as non-blocking, so a blocking
 * guard failed open without notice. Measured: two libs on the privacy guard path
 * are reached only through other libs, and one hook imports a sibling outside
 * lib/, so "direct ./lib/* imports" would have missed both.
 *
 * The scan is a regex over the source, not a parser: the import surface of the
 * hooks is one syntactic family with explicit extensions, plus a dynamic
 * import() with a string literal. live-hook-integrity.mts loads its own libs
 * that way so it can report one it cannot load (issue #279); a computed
 * specifier is not seen, and `typeof import()` is a type, never loaded.
 * bootstrap/hook-require-resolution.test.mts holds the repo to that and checks
 * the closure against the install manifest with these same functions. A
 * leading byte order mark (PowerShell 5.1, Notepad) is dropped before the scan.
 *
 * A file that is a link, or sits in a linked directory, is loaded by Node from its
 * target (issue #524): when the reader names the real path, its imports resolve
 * from the real directory, bounded by the real hooks directory, and are named
 * under the wired hooks directory. Known limit: a link in the middle of a
 * specifier path (`../<alias>/x.mts` back through the alias) is not followed.
 *
 * Runtime-neutral on purpose: hooks directory and readers are parameters, so a
 * Codex counterpart can reuse the walk. Paths are strings (workspace-scope), so
 * POSIX and Windows payloads resolve the same way.

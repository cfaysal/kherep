// R5 of restore-write.mts (issue #279; moved out of restore-write.test.mts for
// issue #507, part 2): an access-control list on the target belongs to the inode,
// so an in-place write keeps it, and a write-denying one stops the write before a
// byte lands. Only the target leaf carries the ACL (../acl-fixture.mts); Windows
// runs both cases with icacls, macOS and Linux with their own tools. The W5 cases
// below change a directory instead: where an absent target's file is created, and
// whether the hooks directory may get a new name.
// Runs on its own as `node restore-write-acl.test.mts`, like every suite in CI.

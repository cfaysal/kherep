// PreToolUse guard (issue #325): keeps the main checkout of a workspace
// repository on its default branch. Sessions share that checkout, so a branch
// switch there moves every other session's working tree; branch work belongs in
// a linked worktree. Blocks checkout/switch to another ref, a SHA, -b/-B/-c/-C,
// --orphan and --detach in the main checkout (git-dir equals common-dir). File
// checkouts, other verbs, linked worktrees and anything outside the workspace
// pass. lib/main-checkout.mts holds the token walk and the git queries.
//
// The git post-checkout hook is the runtime-independent layer; it can only warn,
// because git runs it after HEAD has moved. Codex reaches this guard through
// codex-hook-adapter.mts, which turns the exit 2 into a JSON deny.

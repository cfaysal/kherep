// Issue #592. The stable entry point of the Claude Control Plane hooks, installed
// as <CLAUDE_HOME>/kherep/control-plane/claude-control-plane-hook.mts. Every
// control-plane command of settings.json names this file, so the commands stay
// the same across upgrades and across the roots an install runs from. It runs
// the hook of the source the installer last ran from, named by the pointer
// beside it, source.json, and fails closed without it: exit 1, one stderr line,
// no stdout, never exit 2 (which would block a prompt or wake a session). Node
// built-ins only: the source it runs is the one it has to find.
//
// Unlike the Codex entry point (codex/hooks/control-plane-hook.mts) it starts no
// second process: the hook is imported into this one and runs as its own main
// module (argv[1] is rewritten to the hook file first, so the hook's own main
// check holds). The wake listener runs for up to 24 hours and ends itself when
// its parent, Claude Code, is gone; it also reads the launch flags of its
// ancestors. In this process its parent, ancestry, stdin, signals and exit code
// are exactly those of a direct hook call. The check per run is the pointer's
// shape and the existence of the hook file (and of the manifest of a source
// pin); `kherep-node doctor` verifies the identity.

// Issue #504. Three contracts of the denied-call journal that its own suites cannot see:
// - lead decision 3: the journal lib holds a fourth copy of the private marker pattern; the three
//   guard copies stay untouched, and all four keep the same source and flags;
// - the worker key is held equal across its five copies;
// - review P3-11: every journal write is fs.promises raced against a cap. A synchronous write would
//   bypass the test seam and still pass against a real temporary home, so the writers' source
//   names no synchronous write call.

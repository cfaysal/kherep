# unattended writer triggered by a session start is a different risk class than
# an unattended reader - so the CHECK has a self-trigger and the CHANGE does not.

# Exit 0 = no orphans, exit 1 = orphans found, exit 2 = the check could not run.
# The third case matters: an orphan count that was never measured must not read
# like a clean space (golden rule 12).

# Retirement half of bootstrap/transaction.sh. Sourced after its helpers.
#
# OP-1136. install.sh installs BY NAME and owns no remove primitive, so a live
# file the repo stopped managing simply stays behind: unmanaged, unwired and
# invisible to drift-check. Deleting it is not an option (Golden Rule 1), so it
# is PARKED. The file moves into a _deprecated/ sibling of its own directory
# after its exact prior version has been copied into the install backup, which
# is what lets rollback put it back at the original path.
#
# A rolled-back retirement deliberately leaves the parked copy where it is:
# removing it would be the delete this primitive exists to avoid. The dated
# suffix is what keeps a later run from ever overwriting an already parked file.
# Two retirements inside the same second would collide on that stamp, so the
# suffix counts up (.<stamp>-1, -2, ...) until a free name is found: a collision
# can no longer abort the install. TX_RETIRE_STAMP overrides the stamp and
# exists only so tests can force that collision; production never sets it.
#
# A _deprecated/ the pass creates is journalled like a created parent (#45).
# Rollback removes it only while it is empty, i.e. when the retirement failed
# before its file landed there. One that holds a parked copy stays, by design.

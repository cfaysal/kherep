# Reads bootstrap/manifest/retired.txt and hands every declared live path to
# transaction_retire_path, so a file the repo no longer manages is parked in a
# _deprecated/ sibling instead of surviving unmanaged and unwired. Own file so
# install.sh stays a readable sequence of phases rather than growing a loop.
#
# An entry is relative to the Claude home, unless it carries the project/ prefix
# that install.sh and drift-check.sh already use for workspace files: those map
# to the workspace (#33). Both kinds are parked the same way, inside the same
# transaction, with their backup under retired/<entry> in the install backup.
#
# A project/ entry is gated (#45): the workspace belongs to the operator, so a
# file is parked only while its content, with CRLF folded to LF, still hashes to
# one of the versions the installer placed. Anything else is kept in place and
# reported as KEEP, without backup or journal entry, and the install goes on.

# Prints the live path a validated retirement entry names. drift-check.sh uses
# the same mapping, so an entry the installer parks is the entry it reports.

# Third-party notices

This file is the complete inventory of third-party material in this
distribution. Kherep's own code is licensed under Apache-2.0; see
[LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE). That licence does not replace or
satisfy a third-party component's own notice obligations.

## Bundled plugin sources

Kherep bundles the components listed below under `codex/parity/plugin-sources/`.
Each is a verbatim snapshot of its upstream source, pinned by the content hash in
`codex/parity/plugin-sources/manifest.json`. Kherep does not modify bundled files,
with the single exception listed under "Changes to bundled files". The snapshot copies
the upstream `agents/`, `commands/` and `skills/` directories
and the licence file, stores line endings as LF as the repository's
`.gitattributes` requires, and adds one marker file, `.canonical-source`, to each
component directory. Where a bundled copy differs from a newer upstream release,
the difference is an upstream change made after the snapshot was taken.

Each component retains its own `LICENSE` file in its directory. Those files, not
this summary, are the governing terms. Where a license text declares no copyright
holder, the holder below is the author declared by the upstream plugin metadata.
The upstream revision is a commit or tag at which every bundled file of the
component equals the upstream file.

## Changes to bundled files

`superpowers@claude-plugins-official`: the upstream snapshot contains
`skills/writing-skills/anthropic-best-practices.md`, a copy of Anthropic's
[Skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices)
documentation. Kherep does not redistribute that copy, because the superpowers
MIT licence cannot grant rights to Anthropic's text. The one line in
`skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` that referred to the file now links to the
documentation page instead. No other bundled file is changed.

## andrej-karpathy-skills licence text

`andrej-karpathy-skills@karpathy-skills` declares MIT in its upstream plugin
manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, author `forrestchang`), in the skill's
front matter (`license: MIT`) and in the License section of its README. The
upstream project ships no licence file and states no copyright line. The text
below is the standard MIT licence reproduced from that upstream declaration,
naming the author as the upstream names it; it was not copied from an upstream
file. The bundled skill is identical to the upstream source.
